# dnd-encounter-builder
Encounter builder for DnD 5e to estimate difficulty.

## About the builder
This encounter builder uses the advice in the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) to estimate the difficulty of an encounter. The DMG suggests estimating difficulty by comparing the party's level to the Challenge Rating (CR) of opponents. This is by converting the CR of opponents into experience, multiplying by an offset based on the number of players and opponents to account for action economy, and then comparing the calculated number to a table of difficulty ranges based on player level.
